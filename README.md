# Full Context Software Development

A Next.js and Chakra UI based personal online book hosting site integrated with Notion as data source, Supabase as the DB, Redis for rate-limiting and Paddle as the payment provider with proper user and session management implemented using serverless functions and hosted on Vercel.

## Project Status

This is a personal past-commercial project that I decided to make publicly available instead of hosting it behind a paywall. It has more than 2 years of full/time work put into it.
The project is production tested by more than 21k visitiors so far, but instead of making it perfect, or even fancy, ... or even half-decent ...
my only goal was to make it good-enough so that I can ship my online book and blog in a stable and scalable way with low costs. The main value was provided by the content itself not by the way I implemented it.

So it's definitevly not a good representation of how I work in my day-job, the project severly lacks testing and could just in general get more love. However I think it can server as a good example or even basis for building a similar SaaS / paid content based product with modern tools.

## Notice

I had to remove a whole bunch of images from the project as those are resources I paid to use but the licenses I bought don't allow for redistribution.
