This is a domain that is detached from our work in the mind of many software engineers. Let the designers do what they do, just give me the requirements - goes the attitude. Don't worry, I have no intention of converting any developer to a different profession, on the contrary. I want to show you, how our work and knowledge is complementary in creating and delivering the best user and customer experiences. However to get there we need to understand a little bit about the basics of CX, to have the vocabulary necessary to address the topic in our day-to-day work and in this material.
