Because it’s low-level, complex and has a niece application, leadership decides to hire an expert ("],["let’s call her Samantha",[["i"]]],[") to spearhead the adoption. The product in question has been in development for 4 years by multiple teams. Introducing the codebase to Samantha in necessary detail took away most of the capacity of important members for two weeks. As she introduced the new tool to the project, she also taught its usage to the developers, so after a month, mostly everyone is comfortable to ship new features with it.\n\nLet’s examine the first changes you might notice working on this project. Your team lead announces that a consultant is joining the department to improve the product. The plans for the next sprint have to be changed because a key team member is required for the onboarding. The product owner removes bugfixes from the scope and the developers are happy ("],["including you…",[["i"]]],[") because those are frustrating to deal with. Starting from the third week, there are some refactoring efforts going on to integrate a new library into the overall codebase. Samantha turns out to be quite nice to work with. There’s synergy between the parties. The effort plays out nicely. Application performance has improved. Thanks to that, some long-standing customer complaints go away, support tickets go closed. You get a one day training on how to use the tool with a fine company launch included. The senior engineers seem to like the library, so the rest of the teams get on board easily.\nLife is good. 🍹😎\n\nI’m sure you already spotted how the elements of the first level are involved. The application speedup affects the "],["Product",[["b"]]],[". Omitting the bugfixes changed the release performance, and the gone complaints are a pure example of what feedback is. Now you might also need to resolve production issues involving the library, which can affect the quality of support you provide. All of these are parts of the "],["Service",[["b"]]],[" aspect. There are temporary changes in the "],["Development process",[["b"]]],[" because of the missing members and the refactoring going on. There’s also a permanent one in the form of adopting the library by every team.
