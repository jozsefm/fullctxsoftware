When it's implemented similarly to what I just described the problem mentioned at the beginning is visible. The business track doesn't propagate their goals to development directly. The design phase translates it into their output so their own concerns about the users and the desired business outcomes are presented to us encoded in the designs and requirements, without much emphasis on explicitly showing them. However this doesn't prevent us from having insights into the product that no one else has. What can we learn about our unique perspective from the position of development and the available information at that stage? First, stating the obvious, nobody else is deeply involved with the intricacies of the already existing systems regarding their code, architecture, non functional properties and inner workings. As experts of our field we are best suited to tell what's the optimal way to create the desired software. With most agile("],["ish",[["i"]]],["), iterative development methodologies there's a back-and-forth between the tracks. On this kind of projects we regularly have a chance to redefine or bargain about the incoming requirements.
