There will be some second level items in the list which I consider important enough to discuss individually even if they are just a component of a more generic concern. I will show the effects of every factor on all related APIs and highlight their most relevant business effects. It's interesting to see where do these relationships come from. The two starting points are the user and organization values. Combined together they show which financial effects are related. These are documented in Chapter 8 and 12. The affected business values can simply be looked up in Chapter 5 based on the financial factors. The market consequences are already identified in Chapter 8 for each element of the User API.
