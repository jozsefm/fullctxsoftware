By quality here I mean the ratio of caught vs. uncaught bugs in the tested software, both functional and non-functional ones. We only have a real role here in 4 cases: Dev testing during and after finishing development, this means simply checking the results of your work. Second is writing unit tests. The third is usually not our responsibility but it's still quite common to get us to develop automated end-to-end tests. The last is a partial or complete role in implementing the tracking and measurement of non-functional properties.

Then the support type metrics like: mean time to detect in other words the time it takes to detect an issue after it started, mean time to recovery that measures the average time of resolving an incident, mean time to failure which is the average time until the next issue happens, availability/uptime, the percentage of SLA met vs unmet. Sometimes whole lifecycle metrics are accounted here, like lead time, that measures the time it takes to deliver a feature from conception to receiving user feedback."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"2caf217d-5a8f-4a3e-b127-414051cf05b2","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630620479,"last_edited_time":1631630620479,"parent_id":"c8cad7b2-0412-46c2-86d5-43bc48046d88","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"2caf217d-5a8f-4a3e-b127-414051cf05b2","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"59d6c545-386c-4a8e-8648-745c4d3ec8c0":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"59d6c545-386c-4a8e-8648-745c4d3ec8c0","version":1,"type":"text","format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"711ea342-7b06-4a48-9138-3991ce706c8f","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630620476,"last_edited_time":1631630620476,"parent_id":"c8cad7b2-0412-46c2-86d5-43bc48046d88","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"711ea342-7b06-4a48-9138-3991ce706c8f","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"c14f6855-6c75-4814-8f61-e64a10255771":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"c14f6855-6c75-4814-8f61-e64a10255771","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Support",[["b"]]]]},"content":["632aea3d-bdca-43fa-8e49-6743f43229f6"],"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"b5bf2f40-1b4c-40ec-a114-9584f73f4445","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630615717,"last_edited_time":1631630615717,"parent_id":"7eb325a0-4f8d-4817-b2ca-03ab38e969d3","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"b5bf2f40-1b4c-40ec-a114-9584f73f4445","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"632aea3d-bdca-43fa-8e49-6743f43229f6":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"632aea3d-bdca-43fa-8e49-6743f43229f6","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Because automated error detection and developer participation in issue fixing is already discussed at the previous points, the only aspect remaining here is direct customer support.

Improving any of those will affect every part of the delivery process which means they have a much bigger impact area than the step specific aspects.

From the C3 list it affects 3 more items, collaboration, communication and tracking. It plays a major role in enabling the generation of many waste types. I found it really interesting, how this reinforces an idea from the Influencing Business Value chapter about employee engagement. Namely that the workforce is one of the foundations of success for any company. It's clearly visible from here that the higher quality people are employed, the better most processes will go. The second very strong factor is complexity. In the C3 category, It's the source of the need for collaboration and dependencies. It's also a major contributor to the generation of overproducing, waiting, transport and defect wastes and is at least a partial reason of many other types. Whenever possible, reduce the complexity of the business domain, the organizational structure and workflows to improve overall efficiency.

Technology is important here, it can become a bottleneck, but it's far from the most impactful factor in optimizing an organization. However if we neglect our influence over this area, we can ruin the business outcomes.

All you are going to learn here will change these in the end. \n\nWe examine some of the main ideas of two process improvement methodologies Six Sigma and Lean, to learn how technology can influence the efficiency of processes. \n\nSix Sigma aims at making the life of the organization as deterministic as possible that way giving it greater control over the results of work. We take a look on all the steps of the software development workflow and analyze the sources of randomness and variation at each stage. This follows the standard SDLC model laid out in chapter 2, but I extracted 8 common concerns shared by all phases, they are the: human factor, complexity, collaboration, dependencies, communication, tech, tracking and automation. \n\nLean is concerned about reducing the waste generated by the processes. That can mean for example, the unproductive usage of any resource like development time, budget or skills but it has a much wider perspective than that. The method identified 8 types of waste, and I explain how each of them can be translate to software development, they are: overproducing, overdelivering, waiting, transportation, motion, defects, inventory and underutilization.\n\nFor every point in both methods - "],["where it's relevant",[["i"]]],[" - I give examples of how that area can be measured for evaluating the outcomes of improvement attempts. \n\nEquipped with all this knowledge we finish by defining a 9 step process to improve the efficiency of the software development workflow and summarizing how 2 of the common concerns of control has the greatest impact on the overall efficiency of the organization, namely the human factor and complexity."]]},"format":{"page_icon":"💡","block_color":"gray_background","copied_from_pointer":{"id":"8d4453a6-3595-476c-9761-64a6dc2bf788","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630615714,"last_edited_time":1631630615714,"parent_id":"7eb325a0-4f8d-4817-b2ca-03ab38e969d3","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"8d4453a6-3595-476c-9761-64a6dc2bf788","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"56ca11c5-66cb-4ec2-8790-e77e3a0e3614":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"56ca11c5-66cb-4ec2-8790-e77e3a0e3614","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["More

A solution can end up being wrong with a perfect implementation if the requirements or designs were poorly made. When the requirements change frequently, it's hard to create a decent solution. The lack of proper testing is not to blame for the existence of issues but contributes to the delivery of them. Even when the software is well tested and bug-free ("],["never",[["i"]]],["), if the deployment process creates outages or the environment where it runs is unstable it will still make a bad impression of the product as a whole. The time it takes to release a new version can also influence the users' impression of the quality. That speed can be impeded by bad organizational structures and processes, which are sometimes the sole responsibility of management. If the company doesn't listen to feedback from its customers, that will also damage the perception of the product. Lastly unrealistic budget and scheduling can also lead to low quality software even when the best development tools and practices are used. It's our responsibility to call attention to these issues when they are not under our control because many times the decision makers aren't aware of the consequences. I hope for the best outcomes to you in such cases. In my experience these are often the hardest problems to remedy.
