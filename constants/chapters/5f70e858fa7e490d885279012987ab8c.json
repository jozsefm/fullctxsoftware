I soon found out, there are actual laws and principles driving the human dimension, too. We are much more similar than different. Our problems are generic, just as the ways of solving them. From a high level perspective, there are only a couple of ways software can affect us and all of these can be combined into a system that you can easily understand.

This will be important later on. Do you agree that software and code are not the same thing? Pause reading and give it a thought, then continue from here. Did you have some ideas racing through your mind that are trying to contradict the question? Like, what else would software be? It IS code. It has to be written then executed. Software is just that, executed code. Do you completely agree? Better not, because that's not the entire story! It's a distinction I only had made after I started writing this book. Code and software are deeply connected, but depending on which one you look at, the effects are drastically different and their interests are sometimes opposed. I found no better explanation than an example: Think about yourself working on a product. What do you see? Are you looking at the source code? Maybe sometimes checking the app if the modifications you made are really working out as expected? What do you think about? The internal connections of the codebase? The best way to implement something? Ways how to debug that annoying issue that just doesn't want to go away? Whatever is the case, I bet you spend most of your work time with the code. ("],["OK, maybe with meetings",[["i"]]],[") Now think about the user. How do they interact with the product? Are they filling in forms? Or simply tapping and scrolling away? Maybe they are having fun or doing their daily job. Any way, I'm sure they are not looking at your latest commits and how beautifully you applied those design patterns or functional programming techniques in it. It's obvious that from the perspective of these two sides, code and software are totally different things. Code is what you see when developing the product, and software is what you see when using the product. But here comes the catch! They are actually the same thing! Software "],["is",[["b"]]],[" executed code. I said it's not the entire story. This leads to a conflict of interests we usually aren't aware of. We often get praised and recognized for our technical prowess, and we are also hungry for new development challenges. That means we are incentivized and biased to create great code, not so much to create great software. The sad truth is that quality of code can but doesn't necessarily correlate with product success. In some situations, the opposite is true. By lowering the bar for code quality, you can focus more on improving the product's quality from your customers' perspective. Sure, it's a fine balance with temporary gains and long-term consequences, but it highlights the duality of software and code. Because of this nature, we have to win a war on two front lines at the same time."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"68dd7b80-5dd7-4b40-b492-a582b5a65dc4","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630615641,"last_edited_time":1637943120000,"parent_id":"5f70e858-fa7e-490d-8852-79012987ab8c","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"68dd7b80-5dd7-4b40-b492-a582b5a65dc4","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"9d757409-4976-476a-8666-310e660d6887":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"9d757409-4976-476a-8666-310e660d6887","version":12,"type":"quote","properties":{"title":[["We are responsible for producing good code that executes as good software.",[["b"]]]]},"created_time":1633676040000,"last_edited_time":1633676040000,"parent_id":"5f70e858-fa7e-490d-8852-79012987ab8c","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"69364ddc-4657-42d2-ad6f-e0b74935c3d7":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"69364ddc-4657-42d2-ad6f-e0b74935c3d7","version":360,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Our profession holds the necessary knowledge to optimize a code base or a system architecture, but can you honestly say you know how to optimize "],["software",[["i"]]],[" as a product?
