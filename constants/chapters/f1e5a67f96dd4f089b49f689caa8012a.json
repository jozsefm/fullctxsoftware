These connections help in evaluating the results of each alternative."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"2845892d-eac2-4b16-b44a-75d3c5fd4d6e","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630615635,"last_edited_time":1631630615635,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"2845892d-eac2-4b16-b44a-75d3c5fd4d6e","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"b1105616-48f5-422a-bf2f-4a9eeb5ee38a":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"b1105616-48f5-422a-bf2f-4a9eeb5ee38a","version":1,"type":"sub_header","properties":{"title":[["U"],["X",[["b"]]]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"88f58ea1-47c1-49f5-8219-6381ea66d199","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630620595,"last_edited_time":1631630620595,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"88f58ea1-47c1-49f5-8219-6381ea66d199","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"337b4470-9d09-402e-b907-e1ab1e2e7ab2":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"337b4470-9d09-402e-b907-e1ab1e2e7ab2","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["This is going to be the topic where we will spend the majority of this chapter because this is our real home as developers out of the seven commercial factors.

It's important to understand what are we dealing with because it's the biggest part of our role in delivering UX. The definition I like the most puts usability as the union of three dimensions. When the software is all at the same time efficient, effective and satisfying to use it is ultimately usable. Of course usability is a spectrum and no application have to be perfect in all senses to make an over all really good experience. The first element of usability is efficiency. It means the user can do what they want with the speed they prefer. Second is effectiveness, it means how much better can the user achieve their goal by using the software than without it. Or you can make other products and even earlier versions as the reference for comparison. Finally, satisfaction summarizes the impression of individual users about their usage of the product. These might seem quite far from what developers can affect, so let's dig deeper. The key is to understand the part about "],["they can do what they want with their preferred speed",[["i"]]],[". Intuitively you might think about ease of use, and while that is a good optimization goal for UX, it's not the point of effectiveness, so let's address that. How easy-to-use a software can get always depends on it's business domain. When you are creating software to work with incredibly complex real life problems, that will inevitably get reflected on the product. So the users' expectations about the level of easiness is usually proportional to the complexity of the job they are doing. Efficiency should be a higher priority goal for all software. While the main gateways to efficiency are good business modelling, natural workflows and intuitive user interfaces, there are other aspects in play and those will lead to us. Our unique responsibilities are performance and stability. They have a crucial part in providing a good UX. These worth separate books on their own and are also platform, language and framework specific so I will only give a general overview. I think we are all too familiar with the ways how buggy, crashing, or lagging, slowly loading programs can ruin even the nicest experiences. So the implementation can make-or-break the vision created by the designers. We will now zoom in on both categories and I will explain in how they affect UX in practice.

Even though it's web focused, the performance targets are based on the characteristics of human perception. Here are the main takeaways from there. If we want to make the users to feel their workflow uninterrupted and continuous, the maximum delay between the different steps, like navigating views or submitting forms, is 1 second. Whenever the users interact with the software we have a roughly 100 ms window to react, without negatively affecting their sense of performance. This means in many cases the real time frame we have is even smaller as the runtime and OS has it's own things to do and their overhead should be accounted for. The exact numbers are always specific to the target software and hardware environment. If you wonder how the reaction to user input and the steps of a workflow differ, think of them as the time we have to start an operation after the input event and the time we have to finish it. In case of animations, 60 fps is the standard goal because we are really good at noticing stutter. To reach that we have 16 milliseconds for delivering an update to the screen. This again includes all the overhead processing so the real budget we have for our code to run is less than that."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"3b8b539f-f513-4162-884b-ca4f2dd96f63","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630615631,"last_edited_time":1631630615631,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"3b8b539f-f513-4162-884b-ca4f2dd96f63","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"2e4ff452-6ebf-44f3-809e-6edea54f795b":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"2e4ff452-6ebf-44f3-809e-6edea54f795b","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["A related concern is performance testing which is a huge topic on it's own, all we need here it to note it's also an important factor in ensuring consistent high performance on the long run."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"7946eaa9-dfb6-41ce-b0c0-d1df8da7696c","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630620585,"last_edited_time":1631630620585,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"7946eaa9-dfb6-41ce-b0c0-d1df8da7696c","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"7d5e891e-fa03-4889-8f9e-0a4e345ec550":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"7d5e891e-fa03-4889-8f9e-0a4e345ec550","version":1,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["In general ensuring top performance that doesn't degrade over time is one of our most important task and it involves a large variety of specialized knowledge.

So logging, error reporting, crash info gathering, performance monitoring are all things that, if we do right, help to resolve our customers' problems.

Influencing the demand for our product is not really a developer concern, but the other factor of price which is the total cost of producing the goods is much more relevant. From economics 101 we know that total cost (TC) is made up of two parts the fixed and variable costs. The first part includes the things that are constant whatever amount of the product is created. The second of course is what scales with the produced number. Two examples of fixed costs would be rental fees and cost of services like security or insurance. The most significant variable cost is wage as the volume of labor scales with the work needed to be done. Raw material costs are also included here, in our case license fees can be considered that. The relationship between TC and price is quite clear to everyone. It's obvious this is where our choices can make a huge difference. The most important factors are productivity and utilization.

This is the number one most important business goal for many companies and the whole point of bothering with understanding the customer lifecycle. Yet, we can't really influence it directly by only working on software. This proves that software is just a tool, in reality we are trying to form business relationship with real humans. In order to do that, we can contribute the most by putting emphasis on the parts where we actually get into contact with them. Support, feedback, release performance and community. This is their order of relative impact. As the current generation of technologies mature and improving the user experience starts to have diminishing returns in order for businesses to succeed, attaining customer loyalty is getting even more important. I think we will see more and more emphasis on building up this kind of relationship even within the software development discipline. A good example of this already happening is the rising number of Dev Community Manager, DX Advocate and similar positions that all try to engage the customers ("],["us",[["i"]]],[") of the dev tool companies to increase bonding and gain bigger market shares."]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"77ff20e5-78d7-41fa-bf3e-ad004b8cab62","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630609562,"last_edited_time":1638957540000,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"77ff20e5-78d7-41fa-bf3e-ad004b8cab62","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"617d3b93-323d-453e-859f-3253254387e5":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"617d3b93-323d-453e-859f-3253254387e5","version":1,"type":"sub_header","properties":{"title":[["TL;DR "]]},"format":{"copied_from_pointer":{"id":"8195b87e-2c4a-4c2c-b3d3-9f8c2cd87ff7","table":"block","spaceId":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"created_time":1631630620586,"last_edited_time":1631630620586,"parent_id":"f1e5a67f-96dd-4f08-9b49-f689caa8012a","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"copied_from":"8195b87e-2c4a-4c2c-b3d3-9f8c2cd87ff7","created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"653ed392-16f2-46aa-8cb9-5f2dcac1c5ff","space_id":"84138d69-f20d-4d47-bfa2-a38c59d203d2"}},"c75b2706-eaad-40d5-b971-1b8de74f21f4":{"role":"editor","value":{"id":"c75b2706-eaad-40d5-b971-1b8de74f21f4","version":34,"type":"callout","properties":{"title":[["The developer's responsibilities\n",[["b"]]],["\n"],["Functionality",[["b"]]],[": Delivering consistently high-quality, bug-free features.

Keeping the number of features to the minimum that adds user value. We are the only ones to know what's the threshold before the speed would suffer so challenge the feature ideas and use our unique insight to offer alternatives.\n\n"],["UX",[["b"]]],[": We have a direct role in 4 of the 7 facets. The most important is usability. Our job can be summed up in a single sentence: Do not disrupt usage. Our role is to manifest the designed UX unhindered. We need to let it PASS development. That stands for Performance, Availability, Stability, Security. The aspects that can ruin a smooth experience and the aspects only a developer can affect. The other three are findability, accessibility and credibility. Their respective main technical concerns are: SEO and online access, keyboard and screen-reader support, bug-free and brand conforming software.\n\n"],["Release performance",[["b"]]],[": There are 4 main factors affecting the highest achievable performance. Criticality: How secure and correct should the software be on release. Architecture & Infrastructure: Both the software and hardware choices can make a huge difference here.

Productivity: The most directly influenced field, whenever we speed up the work it contributes to enabling frequent releases.\n\n"],["Support",[["b"]]],[": Our involvement varies a lot by the job and company but we should share our knowledge about the usage of the software with the persons offering support, including the list of known bugs, available documentation and manuals, release notes, feature roadmap etc..

Lastly we are the ones to fix the reported issues. \n\n"],["Price",[["b"]]],[": Mostly our part revolves around lowering the costs of development and maintenance.
