        <b>Short description</b>: This is when the implemented code turns into a usable product, accessible to the end users.
        The result can take many shapes, a new boxed software, updates on servers, a physical product (both hardware and software)
        or digital product (accessible through app or web-stores). For evaluation, we are interested in any technical property
        that can influence the quality of the release process, meaning its speed, failure-rate and how easy it is to recover from a
        failure.

        <b>Remix</b>: The framework itself has no direct influence over this stage, however the deployment targets it supports have, a lot.
        In the end, Remix delivery is simply uploading the new backend and frontend code to the production environment. Let's take a <i>(somewhat shallow)</i> look
        at the currently supported options:

        Just looking at the list proves it without a shadow of a doubt that any project can find its ideal deployment target and -workflow
        when using Remix. This is great for the framework as it boosts adoption, which is great for the developers as it leads to
        better support and more innovation, which in turn is also great for the users as they will get a more mature and reliable product.
        A more in-depth look on the specific business implications of each platform is simply beyond the scope of this review. <i>
